## Project Status

I have built the basic University Course Management System with core features like course creation, updating, deletion, and viewing. I am currently working on adding important functionalities such as:

* Secure login/authentication
* Course registration functionality
* Administrative controls
* Dockerization for deployment

These updates will enhance the systemâ€™s security, usability, and scalability.

Feel free to contribute or open issues!
